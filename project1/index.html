	<h1>Welcome to Kai's Portfolio</h1>

	<p>
		Hi, my name is Khanh Ho, but I'm more commonly known as Kai. I'm 21 and I come from Vietnam.
		Currently, I'm a third-year student at the <a href="http://www.rit.edu">Rochester Institute of Technology</a>, pursuing a bachelor's degree in Software Engineering.
	</p>

	<p>
		I have an unwavering love for computers and technology, which explains why most of my interest and hobbies are computer-related.
		I enjoy playing games <strong>and</strong> making them. I dabble in 3D modeling from time to time.
		I also love Korean language and culture. When I'm not feeling creative, I watch Korean dramas and TV shows.
	</p>

		This site contains my online portfolio, so feel free to explore the other pages to know more about me!
